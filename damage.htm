    <h1>Termite Pest Infestation Damage</h1>
    </p>
    <p>Termite damage is estimated at $2  billion nationally.  Of that amount, approximately $500 million is  attributable to the State of Florida.  Homeowners insurance typically does  not pay for termite damage.  Since the EPA&rsquo;s banning of the termiticide  chlordane in 1988, many Florida homeowners are unhappily learning about the  limited<strong> </strong>protection  provided by a termite repair guarantee. </p>
    <p>Repair guarantees can offer to repair  damage up to $250,000.  Unfortunately, these guarantees give homeowners a  false sense of security.  Most homeowners believe that if they have a  termite infestation, the termite company will find the damage and repair the  damage.  This is not necessarily true.  To protect their homes,  homeowners must take an active role in finding the damage and seeing that  repairs are done properly.    </p>
    <p><strong>Finding Damage </strong></p>
    <p>Termites are  cryptic insects.  The damage they cause is usually hidden behind walls  making it difficult to find damage.  To estimate the extent of damage, a  homeowner must closely examine areas that show signs of infestation.  See Infestation.   For example, on close examination of a swarm, there may be a small hole in the  baseboard or the windowsill.  What the homeowner needs to know is that the  damage could go far beyond just replacing the baseboard or windowsill. </p>
    <p>A house is a  compilation of components that makeup what you see and don&rsquo;t see (structural  components).  These components that you don&rsquo;t see are the ones that are  damaged by termites and are the most difficult to detect and repair.   Coming from the ground up just think of all the wood the termites had to eat to  get to your windowsill.   All houses depend on structural components  to function and must pass code requirements in order to receive a &ldquo;certificate  of occupancy&rdquo;.  When termites eat these structural components a house is  no longer in compliance with accepted industry standard as outlined by the  building code.  The consequences of such damage can result in the failure  of the house, e.g., walls collapsing, windows falling out, doors falling off,  etc.  The damage can also prevent a homeowner from selling their home for  full market value (diminution of value) because mortgage companies will not  finance a home with extensive termite damage and buyers are reluctant to  purchase a home that has had frequent infestations. </p>
    <p>           What should a homeowner do when they know that termites have invaded their  house?  Unfortunately, pest control companies may not be motivated to  investigate damage – they have no contractual obligation to investigate  infested areas.  There is an inherent conflict of interest because the more  damage a termite company finds, the greater their liability.  Because of  this conflict, a homeowner should seek independent professional help in  discovering the extent of the damage.  Here are some guidelines to  in  choosing a contractor:</p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>Ask the contractor if permits      for repairs will be pulled and who will pull them?  All repair work      involving structural components will require a permit by a licensed      contractor.  The local authorities will require inspections to ensure      that the work is within the industry standards.  </li>
      <li>Ask how the contractor will      determine the extent of the damage since some is hidden?  Will they cut      holes in the drywall, use an ice pick, or use moisture meters? </li>
      <li>Ask if they are willing to give      detailed defensible estimates to the termite company to assist in      negotiating a settlement. </li>
      <li>Ask for references and call the      building code inspector in your city, the Better Business Bureau, and the      state licensing board to find out if there have been any complaints. </li>
      <li>Ask to see their proof of      license, insurance and bonding.</li>
    </ul>
    <p> </p>
    <p>After  finding a qualified contractor, you should begin to investigate damage.   Most termite companies require you to have a company representative present when  opening walls.  Be sure to videotape and photograph the  investigation.  Document and keep all correspondence between you and the  pest control company.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Another method of  investigating damage is a new technique called resistograph testing.  See  the following websites for more information.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2><strong>Negotiating Damage Claims</strong> </h2>
    <p>If you discover  damage, the negotiation process will begin.  Be aware that a termite  company is similar to an insurance company in that they want to repair your home  as inexpensively as possible.  However, unlike an insurance company, the  &ldquo;bad faith&rdquo; laws that govern insurance claim practices are not applicable to  the pest control industry.  This can leave a homeowner at a  disadvantage.   </p>
    <p>Claims are  frequently denied because of no "live" termites, excessive moisture,  conducive conditions (conditions that support termites) or no structural  damage.  These denials may be valid or invalid.  Some pest  control companies deny valid claims because they gain substantial financial and  economic advantage by denying claims.  The unchallenged denials can save  them considerable amounts of money which in reality they would otherwise be  obligated to pay.    </p>
    <p>Many homeowners  may not realize when their claims are denied unfairly.  Homeowners usually  trust their pest control company and do not challenge their decision to deny a  claim.  Don&rsquo;t let this happen to you!  Fight back and make your pest  control company accountable - the squeaky wheel does get the grease!  Here  are some suggestions if your pest control company denies a claim that you  believe is valid. </p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>Don&rsquo;t accept their denial      without a fight. </li>
      <li>Ask them to put the reasons for      the denial in writing. </li>
      <li>Ask them to document the      specific investigation they performed to determine why the claim was      denied.  Were moisture meters used to determine excessive moisture? </li>
      <li>Document all events, notes and all      contacts and communications made, whether written or verbal with the termite      company. </li>
      <li>Complain if the claim was not      handled in a timely manner.  </li>
      <li>Write a letter and send it      certified mail to the Director of Claims or President of the Pest Control      Company citing the relevant provisions of the guarantee and demonstrating      that the Company's denial of the claim is unreasonable.  Copy the      letter to the Attorney General in your State and the Department of      Agriculture for review and assistance in the matter.    </li>
      <li>Consider hiring a professional      entomologist to determine if the damage was attributable to the pest control      company&rsquo;s negligence in performing a treatment.  If the termite      damage is attributable to their negligence, the pest control company should      be liable regardless of the conducive conditions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Some termite  companies may honor your claim but give you a reduced settlement.    Attempting to settle a claim for less than the amount to which a reasonable man  would have believed he was entitled to would be an unfair claims practice.   Document, complain and fight back!  Termite companies are required to do a  &ldquo;first rate repair&rdquo; (Del  Guidice versus Orkin), or they may be liable for the diminished value of  your home caused by termite damage.</p>
    <p>Even when a termite  company requires you to use their contractor, request that you use your  own.  A termite company may not hire the most qualified contractor to  repair your home.  Again, the termite company&rsquo;s incentive is to repair  your home as inexpensively as possible.</p>
    <p>If  you must use the pest control company&rsquo;s general contractor, confirm that they  pull a building permit and request all of the required inspections.  You  may confirm this information with the county building department.  Note  that while termite companies normally perform background checks on their  employees, they may not perform background checks on the general contractors  they hire.  You may want to investigate the background of their contractor. </p>
    <h3>Common Mistakes</h3>
    <h1>Mistake 1.   Letting a termite company discourage you from opening walls.</h1>
    <p>Termite companies  frequently discourage customers from opening walls (not necessarily an expensive  undertaking) by emphasizing that the homeowner is responsible for the cost of  the investigation if no live termites or damage is found.  By not opening  walls, termite companies are given time to kill the termites and possibly later  deny claims because there are no live termites.  If you have a swarm or  sign of an active infestation, open your walls as soon as possible with a  termite company representative present.  The cost to open a wall by a  qualified carpenter or contractor is usually immaterial compared to the cost of  ignoring damage.  To protect yourself, DOCUMENT the opening with  videotape.  </p>
    <h1>Mistake 2.  Believing that  your termite company wants to find all of the damage.</h1>
    <p>If you have  damage in a baseboard, termite companies may indicate that the damage is just in  the baseboard.  Don&rsquo;t rely on your termite company to find more  damage.  Homeowners must be very aggressive in finding and uncovering  damage.  If termites are eating your baseboards, it is very likely that you  have structural damage in your walls.  Remember termites come from the  ground up daily and eat wood from the ground up. </p>
    <h1>Mistake 3.  Accepting the  denial of your claim.</h1>
    <p>Claims are  sometimes denied without proper investigation – termite companies claim either  that there are no live termites, no structural damage or moisture  conditions.  All of these claims may or may not have validity; however,  termite companies frequently apply these claims to their advantage to avoid  paying valid claims.  In the insurance industry, this practice may be  considered an unfair claims practice.  But remember all of those unfair  claims practices that govern an insurance company are not applicable to a  termite company.  There are no laws in Florida to protect a consumer  against an unscrupulous termite company that knowingly denies valid  claims.  If a claim is denied, ask for the company to put the denial in  writing with an explanation as to why the claim was denied.  Ask for  documentation of denial and investigative steps taken by company to determine  whether the claim was valid.  Be sure to document the company&rsquo;s  investigation.  Remember Document, Document, and Document! Then FIGHT  BACK…THE SQUEAKY WHEEL DOES GET THE GREASE!  File a complaint with the  Better Business Bureau, the Attorney General, the Department of Agriculture,  call the consumer reporters for your local TV station and newspapers, etc.   Valid claims should not be denied! </p>
    <h1>Mistake 4.  Believing that  you have an &ldquo;aerial&rdquo; colony.</h1>
    <p>A termite company  may deny a claim because of excessive moisture.  In many homes in the  southeast, there are minor leaks in outside walls or windows.  Termites  need moisture and can generally be found in high moisture areas.  Some  contracts state ambiguously that the customer is responsible for termite damage  when water leakage allows &ldquo;termites to exist in my building&rdquo; and thus the  effectiveness of their treatment is destroyed.   For termites to exist  in a building, there must be an &ldquo;aerial colony&rdquo;.  An aerial colony is  an above ground colony of termites that do not need to return to the ground for  moisture; whereas subterranean termites must originate from the ground.   Thus, if termites are going to the ground, the company should be liable for at  least part if not the entire repair regardless of the amount of moisture.   Termite company managers eventually admit this when confronted directly with  this argument.  Most homeowners and even attorneys do not understand the  &ldquo;moisture&rdquo; clause in termite contracts.  Ask the Termite Company  Manager if the termites are coming from the ground.  State that you believe  they are and that their supposedly continuous barrier has been ineffective and  they should be liable for the repair.  Aerial Colonies are very rare  occurring less that .001 percent of the time for native subterranean termites.</p>
    <h1>Mistake 5.  Assuming the  general contractor hired by your termite company will comply with state building  laws and pull a permit.</h1>
    <p>In three major  metropolitan areas (Tampa, Jacksonville and Orlando) and probably all areas of  the country, some termite companies are hiring contractors that are violating  state building laws (a misdemeanor) by not pulling permits. It is clear that  their intent in repairing homes is to complete the work as fast and cheap as  possible, with little regard to the right way to make repairs or the proper  procedures for licensing, permitting and inspections.  Unpermitted repairs  reduce the value of your home and could prevent future buyers from purchasing  your home.  Also, it is difficult to get financing or insurance on a home  with construction defects or termite damage.  If a termite company  contractor has performed repairs to your home, call your local building  department to confirm whether or not a building permit has been pulled on your  home.  If one has not been pulled, send a letter to your termite company  and ask them to have your home repaired legally and inspected properly.  If  a termite company is sending a contractor to your home, ask the termite company  and the contractor to pull a permit!  All repair work performed by a  termite company contractor requires building permits – don&rsquo;t let your  termite company tell you otherwise. </p>
    <p>Mistake  6.  Complying with your termite company and signing a release so the  contractor can get paid.</p>
    <p>Some termite  companies require customers to sign a &ldquo;release&rdquo; that releases the company  from liability for the repairs and termite damage.  Companies present the  release as something that &ldquo;needs&rdquo; to be signed so that the contractors can  get paid.  The termite company has the contractor present the release to  the customer.  Customers <u>do not</u> have to sign the release.   Apparently, customers only have to sign a release if they receive something  beyond the terms of the original contract. </p>
    <h1>Mistake 7.  Believing that  the repair work is First-Rate.</h1>
    <p>In <em>DelGuidice  v. Orkin</em>, even after seventeen ineffective termite treatments, Orkin was  not liable for diminished value of a home as long as Orkin provided a  &ldquo;first-rate repair&rdquo; of the property.  Some termite companies are not  doing first-rate repair work.  They frequently do repairs from the inside  of the home – without regard to the proper construction techniques.   Demand that a licensed contractor repair your home to like-kind condition.   If your home is not repaired in like-kind condition, the company could be liable  for diminution of value of your home.</p>
