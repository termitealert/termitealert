    <h1>Termite Infestation </h1>
    </p>
    <p align="left">Termites are   cryptic insects and are difficult to detect.  However, they do       present themselves via swarms, mud tunnels, pin holes, or soft wood. These are a clear indication of termite infestation.   Documentation is the most important step homeowners can take to protect   themselves in dealing with termite infestation.  Videotape, photograph and keep   accurate records.  You may want to save the swarmers in a zip-lock bag.    When you open the walls, have your pest-control company present so they can see   live termites.  The companies will not pay for repairs unless they see LIVE   termites.  </p>
    <p align="left"> </p>
    <p align="left"> Swarmers</p>
    <p>Swarming of winged adult termites is typically one of the   first signs of termite infestation.  This usually begins in early spring and   occurs when a termite colony reaches a certain size. Swarmers are poor fliers   and they only use their wings to swarm.  A homeowner may encounter a small swarm   of winged termites running on the floor or they may encounter piles of broken   wings especially around windowsills and doorways, usually near areas of   sunlight.  In most instances of swarming, the colonies only swarm one to two   times.  If you there is a swarm inside your home, the termites are not   coming from your   neighbor&rsquo;s yard! A swarm is usually indicative of termite damage. </p>
    <p>  </p>
    <h2>Mud Tunneling</h2>
    <p> </p>
    <p> Another obvious sign of infestation is mud tunneling. The &lsquo;worker&rsquo; termites   build mud shelter tubes from bits of soil and excretion. These tubes provide a   passageway from the termite colony to the food source, the wooden structure of   most homes. These shelter tubes are usually seen on the outside of foundations   or interior wood molding.    Some may be as small as a pen to several inches wide.  If termites are   active in the tubes, you will see them when you scrap away the dirt.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p><strong>Pin Holes</strong></p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Look for unexplained   small holes in your interior walls.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p><strong>Soft Wood</strong></p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Use a rubber mallet to   determine if interior wood molding is soft or rotted.  Blistering paint may   also be a sign. </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p><strong>Common Misconception</strong></p>
    <p> </p>
    <p><strong> Swarms are not indicative of infestation or damage.</strong></p>
    <p> Some termite company representatives have been known to tell     their customers the following:</p>
    <p> ·    &ldquo;Reproductive     Termites (Swarmers) continue to swarm after the worker termites are killed&rdquo; –     this is wrong!  (Termites will only swarm for 30-45 days after a treatment.) </p>
    <p> ·    &ldquo;Swarmers     are from the neighbor&rsquo;s yard&rdquo; – if the termite swarmers are from inside your house     this is most likely wrong.</p>
    <p> ·    &ldquo;Swarmers     are mutating termites&rdquo;  </p>
    <p> If you have     a swarm inside your home, most likely there is termite damage near the     origination of the swarm.  Homeowners should carefully examine these     areas by cutting drywall or probing with an ice pick.  Termite companies     may discourage you from doing this because in some instances the damage behind     the wall could be massive.</p>
