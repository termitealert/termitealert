    <h1>Termite Treatments</h1>
    </p>
    <p align="left">Most   homeowners know very little about  whether or not termite treatments have been performed properly.  There are   basically two choices of treatment - chemical treatment and bait systems.    Some homeowners may choose to have both.  Below you will find some general   information and links to help you make an informed decision regarding chemical   treatments vs. bait systems.  </p>
    <p align="left"> To protect your rights, keep all of your termite   treatment and inspection records.  In addition, if you are a Florida homeowner,   your termite company is required to place a treatment sticker on your electrical box   or near your attic access.  If   a sticker has not been posted, call your company and ask to have one posted.    If they fail to do so, consider reporting the violation to the Department of   Agriculture.</p>

    <p align="left"> Chemical Treatment     </p>
    <p align="left"> Termiticides, a liquid pesticide, have been used in the past as the standard   method of termite control.  The purpose of this method is to provide a   continuous chemical barrier around the home preventing termites from penetrating   the treated soil where the termites are either repelled or killed.    Effective treatment usually requires heavy equipment, substantial labor time and   a large volume of chemical.  A typical   barrier treatment may involve hundreds of gallons of chemicals.  </p>
    <p align="left"> The articles below discuss the most effective chemical treatments being used   today.  Whether you are building a home or having an existing home treated,   be sure to request the best chemical at the highest labeled rate.</p>

    <p align="left"> Bait Systems </p>
    <p align="left"> Termite food, wood or paper, is put in a tube and inserted below the ground at   10-15 foot intervals around the home. The station is monitored on average once a   month.  If termites are found, a slow acting poison is placed in the tube   and trailed to the colony.  The goal of the bait system is to entice   termites to feed on the poison, therefore, destroying the colony.  The more   bait stations installed, the better the chances are of locating termites. Bait   systems require patience and persistent monitoring. </p>

    <p align="left"> Common Mistakes </p>
    <p align="left"> 1)         Trusting your termite company to use the best chemical.     There are many different chemicals that can be used to treat subterranean   termites. Some chemicals repel termites while other chemicals kill termites. Be   sure to request that your company use the best chemical.  A non-repellant that   kills termites is best. </p>
    <p align="left"> 2)     <strong>Assuming your termite company will use the proper volume of chemical</strong>.   Most termite companies allow their technicians to determine the proper amount of   chemical to use on your house. Technicians may use insufficient   amounts of chemical and fail to establish a continuous barrier. To insure that your termite   company has used the minimum amount of chemical, see the label instructions.</p>
    <p align="left"> 3)         Believing that your company will check all of the bait stations consistently.     For the bait systems to be effective, all of the bait stations must be   monitored periodically. To insure all of the bait stations are monitored, follow   the technician as he checks each station and keep a record of all bait station   inspections.  If a company fails to inspect the stations, call or write   your pest control company immediately.    </p>
